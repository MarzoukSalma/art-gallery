# 🎨 Art Gallery – Interactive Generative Art Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

**Art Gallery** is an academic project that combines **generative art**, **data visualization**, **image/audio manipulation**, and **web interactivity** into a single interactive platform.

The project is implemented in **Python** and delivered as a **Flask web application**, allowing users to explore, generate, transform, and interact with digital artworks in real time.

This project follows an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** approach and integrates multiple Python libraries commonly used in creative coding and data science.
